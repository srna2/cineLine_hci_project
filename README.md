# CineLine - Human Computer Interaction Project

A cinema ticket reservation system is a software-based system that allows movie lovers to reserve tickets for movies in advance. This system is typically available online through the cinema's website or through a mobile app.
The cinema ticket reservation system allows users to browse available movies and projection time, select their preferred seats, and pay for their tickets electronically. The system may also offer additional features such as the ability to purchase concessions in advance, choose preferred seating options, and receive confirmation of the reservation via email or text message.
